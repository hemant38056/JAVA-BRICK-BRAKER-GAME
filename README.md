# JAVA-BRICK-BRAKER-GAME
Build the Brick Breaker Game Using the Java Concepts.

Java is widely used for game devlopment.
BrickBreaker game is widely used in 1970s.
In BrickBreaker, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen and the goal is to destroy them all. 
A ball moves straight around the screen, bouncing off the top and two sides of the screen. When a brick is hit, the ball bounces back and the brick is destroyed. 
The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen; to prevent this from happening, the player has a horizontally movable paddle to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play. 
The player uses the platform to keep the ball running. The goal is to break the bricks without missing the ball with your platform.


Project makes the use of Java concepts (AWT, Swing, JFrane, JPanel) and OOPs concepts.

How to Play ?
The player should be able to start the game in the terminal by pressing the ENTER key.

The player should be able to move the paddle sideways using the Leftwards and the Rightwards Arrow on the keyboard.

Once the player loses the ball, i.e. when the ball touches the bottom of the screen, the game ends.

Breaking each brick should provide the player a certain number of points. Let's say each brick contains 5 points, if a player breaks 10 such bricks, he gets 50 points.

Once the game ends, the terminal will present the final score of the player and give him the option to restart the game again.
